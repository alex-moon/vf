# VoidFill

VoidFill is a little game I wrote to learn some basic principles
of 3D game design and development on
<a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">ThreeJS</a>
and
<a href="https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/docs/" target="_blank">cannon-es</a>.
It also gave me an excuse to learn about asteroids and the asteroid belt.

## Development

Project setup:
```
yarn install
```

Compile and hot-load for development:
```
yarn dev
```

Build for production:
```
yarn build
```

Wrap in a docker container serving the app with nginx (if you're into that sort of thing):
```
docker-compose build
```
